# Rain-World-Custom-Tiles-and-Props
A repository to keep most of the tiles and props created by the Rain World community members and to share more easily them with others.

A few little rules to upload your files:
- prefer pull requests (direct commits can become messy);
- never replace the whole init.txt from this repo;
- make sure your tile/prop works;
- make sure it doesn't break anything that relies on tile/prop/category order;
- if it's a tile, make sure the preview works properly;
- make sure to put any new category at the end of the init file;
- prefer new custom categories **(optional)**;
- if it's a tile, if possible, make your tile specs enough readable **(optional)**;
- tile/prop fixes are allowed if they make the tile/prop work better than before;
- put your name in the credits file with the tiles you made **(optional)**;

Credit template:
- *[insert contributor(s) name(s) here]* for the *[tile(s)/prop(s)/tile fixe(s)/prop fixe(s)]*: *[insert your tile(s)/prop(s)/tile fixe(s)/prop fixe(s) name(s) here]*, for *[any editor, RW Community editor, Drought editor, MSC editor, ...]*;

That's all I think, have fun!
